# New-York-Solar-Resource-Data

The goal of this project is to extract data from [Data Gov API](https://api.data.gov/docs/) through an API call and transform it into a regular dataframe.

In particolar we'll work with these output fields:

* The Average Direct Normal Irradiance(`avg_dni`): Direct Normal Irradiance is the amount of solar radiation a surface receives per unit area.
* The Average Tilt at Latitude (`avg_lat_tilt`): Tilt at Latitude is the amount of radiation a surface receives per unit area that doesn't arrive on a direct path from the sun.
* The Average Global Horizontal Irradiance(`avg_ghi`): Global Horizontal Irradiance is the total amount of shortwave radiation a surface horizontal to the ground receives from above.
